		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
		<p>The Site I chose to work with is Theater Downtown. Currently this site is in need of some color to liven it up a little, to catch the audiences eye. And organization. This site is intended to show what plays will be held at the facitily along with all the information about each production. It is also to show pricing of seating, when auditions are. I personally think that this site could use a more organized layout and not so bland. So that the users will want to visit this site and things are easier to find.</p>
