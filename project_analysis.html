		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
		<p>The Site I chose to work with is Theater Downtown. Currently this site is in need of some color to liven it up a little, to catch the audiences eye. And organization. This site is intended to show what plays will be held at the facitily along with all the information about each production. It is also to show pricing of seating, when auditions are. I personally think that this site could use a more organized layout and not so bland. So that the users will want to visit this site and things are easier to find.</p>
		
		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
		<p>When I searched "Theater Downtown" almost a dozen websites came up and the Theater Downtown website was second on the list. I think that the web site could use a few more keywords other than orlando theater, downtown orlando, and theater orlando. If we added more there is a better chance that it could be at the top of the Alexa.com site. On Google Adwords the competition is low and at the top of the search list, but only when you put in Theater Downtown Orlando. We need to change that so that we don't have to add Orlando at the end.</p>
		
		<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
		<p>The targeted audience would be anyone in the Central Florida area who wants to be in a play and or go see a play production. There are also volunteer opportunities. On the site, it is easy to find when and what plays are going on and the auditions page. Which in a web site, it is always helpful for it to be easy to navigate. </p>
