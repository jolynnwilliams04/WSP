Theatre Downtown is a volunteer organization. Everyone you see onstage, backstage, and in the booth volunteers their time to keep the theatre alive and to produce the shows you see. Why do all that work for free? Volunteering offers a great way to meet interesting people, get to know the Orlando arts community, and learn new skills. Getting involved is easy: Contact us, or attend one of the work calls.
